# 📝 Command-Line To-Do List Manager

This is **Task 1** of my Python internship at **Sarvagna Innovation Pvt. Ltd.**

## 📌 Project Description

A powerful command-line To-Do List Manager using Python.  
This tool allows users to:
- ✅ View all tasks
- ➕ Add new tasks with timestamp
- ❌ Delete tasks
- ☑️ Mark tasks as complete
- ✏️ Edit tasks with update timestamp

Tasks are saved in a local text file (`tasks.txt`) so they remain even after exiting.
